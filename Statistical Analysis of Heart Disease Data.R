#Male sex(OR = 6.54, CI(3.16 - 14.06)), Exercise angina(OR = 3.29, CI(1.72 - 6.32)), old peak(OR = 2.72, CI(1.84 - 4.18)), flat ST(OR = 3.71, CI(1.13 - 11.74)) leads to increase risk of developing heart disease.

#Type ATA chest pain(OR = 0.35, CI(0.13 - 0.92)), Type NAP chest pain(OR = 0.21, CI(0.10 - 0.46)), Type TA chest pain(OR = 0.17, CI(0.05 - 0.49)) are protective against heart disease

#Conclusion
#The model suggests that being male, Exercise-Induced Angina, having high Oldpeak, and having flat ST significantly increases the risk of heart disease.
